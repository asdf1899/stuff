Nowadays you surely came across with the most modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js or React that have changed the way we design web and mobile interfaces.
Thanks to static site generators, modern browsers, CDNs, and APIs, we’re now seeing web developers transition from server-side to client-side applications.
If you have already heard of SSG (static site generators), surely you will have found a new term *JAMstack*.
So let’s see what the JAMstack is and why it is becoming so popular.

### What does JAMstack mean?

> JAMstack is revolutionising the way 
> we think about workflow by providing a 
> simpler developer experience, better performance, 
> lower cost and greater scalability.¹

In short words it's a modern client-side web development architecture that doesn’t depend on a web server.

**JAM** stands for JavaScript, API, Markup.

- **J**avascript: this could be any frontend framework or library.
- **A**pi: server-side or database actions "embedded" in reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript.
- **M**arkup: Deployed prebuilt static HTML using a SSG like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)

### What are the advantages of using the JAMstack?

- Faster and Better Performance
- Better developer experience
- Less expensive
- Higher Security

I would strongly recommend learning more about it because this stack has endless possibilites from this trashy website to large complex webapps.

Actually this random stuff container is under the JAMstack. All the HTML is generated at deploy time, and there is nothing else going on, *maybe*.
