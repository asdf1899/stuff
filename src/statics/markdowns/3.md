### What is Github Pages?

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free static site hosting service used to host **static** projects directly from your Github repository.  
If you know the basics of git and you already have your project 'saved' on Github, then we can start immediately, otherwise I'll leave you a guide [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

So let's start and follow this easy 10 steps.

1. Open a terminal create a new branch in your project and name it 'gh-pages'
	using the following command `git checkout -b gh-pages` 
2. In 'vue.config.js' file (if this file doesn't exist in your project folder, create it) and paste the following code:
	```
	module.exports = {
		publicPath: '/my-repo-name/'
	}
	```
3. In 'vue.config.js' file rename '/my-repo-name/' with your project name
4. Open the file .gitignore located in root directory of the project folder and  comment the line which has the text ‘/dist’.
5. Run this command `npm run build` 
6. Run this command `git add dist && git commit -m "Add dist folder"` 
7. And finally run the following command: ` git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
8. Now open your repository on Github and open 'Settings' tab
9. Scroll until Github Pages section, select 'gh-pages' from source dropdown list and then click on save button.
10. Wait until your project is published.

And "that's all folks!"
