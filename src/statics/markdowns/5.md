## What is Google Analytics

Is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic activities such as session duration, pages, bounce rate etc.


## Vue-analytics

Using [vue-analytics](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-analytics) library you can easly set up Google Analytics inside your Vue project in just few lines of code.

### Installation

***vue-analytics*** can be installed via npm, so open your terminal and type this command:

```
npm install vue-analytics
```

### Set up

Open main.js file and add this lines of code:

```
import Vue from 'vue'
import router from 'router file path' 
import VueAnalytics from 'vue-analytics'; 

Vue.use (VueAnalytics, {
	id: 'your code from google analytics',
	router
})
```

Now you have to replace the router file path and the parameter id with your own analytics tracking ID. 
To retrieve your Google Analytics tracking ID, sign in into your **Google Analytics** account and you can find it under:
Administration > Property > Property Settings > Tracking ID. 

For security reasons I highly recommend using environment variables to store sensitive information such as tracking ID, instead of entering it directly in the id parameter. 
In this way these sensitive key will not be committed and visible to everyone. If you want know how to use enviroment variable click [here](https://dev.to/ratracegrad/how-to-use-environment-variables-in-vue-js-4ko7).

Obviously this library can do a lot of things, I leave you [here](https://github.com/MatteoGabriele/vue-analytics#user-guide) the documentation from Github.
